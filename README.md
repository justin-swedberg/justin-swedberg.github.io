# Design Excellence
The [Design Excellence's] (https://app.glassfrog.com/circles/32386) purpose to ensure iQmetrix has the best designers and our designers are at their best.

In order for the Design Excellence to do fulfill our purpose we must facilitate a community where we can learn from each other. This means that we have to understand that no one designer can know everything about design. Each designer will have strengths and weaknesses in different aspects of design. Designers can teach those areas of design they have strengths in to the other members of the discipline while also learning from others in areas they are less strong in. This will help us create balance across the company and recognize if there are gaps we should be more focused on.

We're not here just to make it pretty or easy to use. Through empathy, we ensure meaning and utility. With craft, we elicit understanding and desire. We wrangle the complexity of our offering to deliver a clear, coherent and satisfying experience from start to finish.
